    <h1>My name is Daniel.</h1>
    <p> I graduated university in 2021 with a B.S in Exercise Science. After graduating, I went to work in a Physical Therapy clinic for over a year. After that, I went to work at Best Buy and discovered my passion for problem solving and technology. I decided to enroll in the computer programming and development course to see how I like the program. In my free time, I like to play video games with my friends. I hope to make a video game someday.</p>
